# U.S. Senator's Trading Visualization

## Project Description

### U.S. Senator's Trading Visualization with Alignment to Your Investment Preferences

This project aims to build a data visualization tool to analyze U.S. senator's trading activities, utilizing data scraped from [TrendSpider](https://trendspider.com/markets/congress-trading) and market performance data from APIs like [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com). The application features interactive charts to uncover insights such as popular investment sectors, trading trends, and profit standings among senators. Additionally, a **Align Your Investment Strategy** feature helps users identify senators with investment strategies that align with their own. Built on Streamlit, the project provides a transparent and engaging way to explore senator's trading behaviors and investigate the possibility of insider trading.
