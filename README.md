# Senate Trading Visualization Application

## Project Description

### Senate Trading Visualization Tool Aligned with Your Investment Preferences

This project aims to create a data visualization tool to analyze U.S. senators' trading patterns using scraped data from [TrendSpider](https://trendspider.com/markets/congress-trading) and stock market performance data from APIs like [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com). The tool will feature interactive charts to explore popular investment sectors, trends, and profit standings among senators. Additionally, a "Senator To Watch Tool" that will allow users to find senators with similar investment profiles as their. Designed as a Streamlit-based application, this project provides an engaging way to gain insights into U.S. senator trading activities and help answer if there is some insider trading involved.
